### PROJECT 1 WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION   (LAMP STACK) IN AWS
I started this project by first creating a lamp-stack web server in Aws in my availability zone eu-west 2a, configured the security group with the necessary configuration settings 
SSH on port:22 and HTTP on port :80 thereby creating the necessity FIREWALL.
 I created my private key to be able to connect to my EC2 instance and with the help of the key I was able to use (SSH client) connection to connect to my instance using Gitbash

INSTALLED APPACHE2 
Installed Apache2 using the command below
Sudo apt install appeche2
