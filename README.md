# LAMP-STACK PROJECT

LAMP STACK is basically an open-source software nomenclature used in the development of web application. A web-based application in this case requires an
•	An EC2 instance on AWS name LAMP-STACK
•	Linux Operating system Apache webserver to serve the content,
•	MysQl for the database backend used for storing data, 
•	PHP programming language for coding the business logic
To kick start the beginning of this project i provisioned an EC2 instance on the latest distribution of Ubuntu Server 20.04   on my existing AWS account.
I was able to connect to my EC2 instance (LAMP-STACK) webserver through SSH connection using Gitbash on my machine.
